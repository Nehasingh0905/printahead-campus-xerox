# printahead-campus-xerox
A web-based campus solution for pre-ordering stationery and Xerox/printing jobs to enable faster, queue-free pickup.

🔍 Problem Statement
During peak academic periods such as exams, submissions, and project deadlines, campus stationery and Xerox shops experience heavy crowding. Students often waste significant time standing in queues just to purchase basic supplies or submit documents for printing. This not only causes inconvenience for students but also makes order handling inefficient for store operators.

Orders are prepared beforehand, allowing students to collect them quickly without waiting in long lines.
