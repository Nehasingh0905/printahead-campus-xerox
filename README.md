# PrintAhead – Campus Stationery & Xerox Pre-Order

A web-based campus solution for pre-ordering stationery and Xerox/printing jobs to enable faster, queue-free pickup.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
During peak academic periods such as exams, submissions, and project deadlines, campus stationery and Xerox shops experience heavy crowding. Students often waste significant time standing in queues just to purchase basic supplies or submit documents for printing. This not only causes inconvenience for students but also makes order handling inefficient for store operators.

## 💡 Solution Overview
PrintAhead addresses this problem by introducing a pre-order and pickup system for campus stationery and Xerox services. Students can place orders in advance—selecting stationery items, uploading documents for printing, choosing print configurations, and scheduling pickup times. Orders are prepared beforehand, allowing students to collect them quickly without waiting in long lines.

## ✨ Key Features
- Browse commonly used stationery items with clear pricing  
- Upload documents for Xerox or printing  
- Choose print options such as copies, color mode, sides, and binding  
- Use ready-made print templates (e.g., resumes, lab reports)  
- View an order summary with estimated cost  
- Schedule preferred pickup date and time  
- Clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Styling: Custom CSS with responsive layout  
- Planned Backend: Google Firebase (for order storage and notifications)  

> **Note:** This MVP currently focuses on frontend functionality. Backend integration using Firebase is planned for persistent data storage, notifications, and admin features.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Firebase integration for real-time order storage  
- Email/SMS notifications when orders are ready
